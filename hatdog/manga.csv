Roger was known as the Pirate King, the strongest and most infamous being to have sailed the Grand Line. The capture and death of Roger by the World Government brought a change throughout the world. His last words before his death revealed the location of the greatest treasure in the world, One Piece. It was this revelation that brought about the Grand Age of Pirates, men who dreamed of finding One Piece (which promises an unlimited amount of riches and fame), and quite possibly the most coveted of titles for the person who found it, the title of the Pirate King.

Enter Monkey D. Luffy, a 17-year-old boy that defies your standard definition of a pirate. Rather than the popular persona of a wicked, hardened, toothless pirate who ransacks villages for fun, Luffy’s reason for being a pirate is one of pure wonder; the thought of an exciting adventure and meeting new and intriguing people, along with finding One Piece, are his reasons of becoming a pirate. Following in the footsteps of his childhood hero, Luffy and his crew travel across the Grand Line, experiencing crazy adventures, unveiling dark mysteries and battling strong enemies, all in order to reach One Piece.

On Wet Crow’s Feather Island, a tiny speck in the Sea of Japan, lives Akagami Iria, the exiled daughter of a powerful family. Born into great wealth, she was a princess of the highest pedigree–until she was cut off by the leader of the Akagami Foundation. For the last five years, she’s lived on Feather Island with her maids. But she hasn’t been alone. She has invited the best minds Japan has to offer to come and stay with her.

And so nineteen-year-old college student Ii-chan and his best friend, computer genius Kunagisa Tomo, find themselves as Iria’s guests at her elaborate mansion. Surrounded by fascinating women–a chef, a fortune-teller, a scholar, and an artist, not to mention his own friend Tomo–Ii-chan is feeling a little overmatched intellectually. But the sudden discovery of a grisly murder sends the island into shock. And Ii-chan discovers that he does possess a bit of genius: the ability to discover what is real and what is fake . . . who is who they claim to be–and who is a killer.

Unfortunately they are attacked, and Kagetora is flung into a lake, where he sinks to the bottom. 
Beni is a modern high school girl, but her life is not quite normal. The story begins with her being threatened at knife-point. Not only that, but she is standing on the edge of the roof of a skyscraper. A struggle ensues, but things go from bad to worse when a mysterious boy appears out of thin air and lands on Beni, knocking her off the edge! 
You guessed it—it's Kagetora. There was a time portal in the middle of that lake, and he has slipped forward in time to modern Japan. I suppose that if you are knocked off the edge of a skyscraper, it's good to have a ninja around, because, Kagetora is able to use some of his super ninja skills to save Beni from becoming a pavement pancake. When Kagetora lays eyes on Beni, he is convinced she is his ""Beni-Hime-Sama"" and swears to be her protector.

However, he lost his life during the battle with the Sage Emperor and his six deity-ranked beasts.

His soul was then brought back to when he was still 13 years old. Although he's the weakest in his class and has the lowest potential future talent, having only a red soul realm and a weak one at that, with the aid of the vast knowledge which he accumulated from his previous life, he decides to train faster than anyone could expect. He also decides to help those who died nobly in his previous life to train faster as well. 

He aims to protect the city from the coming future of being devastated by a record number of demon beasts and the previous fate of ending up destroyed. He aims to protect his lover, friends, family and fellow citizens who died in the beast assault or its aftermath. And he aims to destroy the so-called Sacred family who arrogantly abandoned their duty and betrayed the city in his past life.

Coming from a distinguished family, he is an infamous perfectionist; not only is he highly critical of himself, but of others as well.

On the surface, she seems to be an unkempt girl with no direction in life. However, when Chiaki hears Nodame play the piano for the first time, he is in awe at the kind of music she plays. To Chiaki's dismay, Nodame moves into the apartment next to his and finds out that she is head over heels in love with him.
Nodame Cantabile tells the story of Chiaki and Nodame, as they not only learn to deal with each other, but learn lessons from one another as they strive for the top of the musical world.

This is the story of four travelers, bound by fate and by prophesied future. Sakura is the princess of Clow Country, and possessor of a strange power that promises to change the world. Syaoran is an aspiring archaeologist and her childhood friend. When Sakura is endangered by the plan a certain man has for the future, the princess' memories are scattered across dimensions in the form of feathers, and Syaoran is forced to go on a desperate journey to retrieve them. They are accompanied by Fay D. Flourite, a magician running from the horrible truth of his past, and Kurogane, a rough-mannered ninja trying to get back to his world. However, the ability to cross worlds demands a great price, and each of them must pay the Dimensional Witch with what he or she values most. In order to save his princess, Syaoran must give up his relationship with her. Even if he gathers all of Sakura's memories, she will never remember their past together...
But the world is not so simple. The very moment these four made this decision, their destinies are sealed into a tragic course...as everyone in the group has their own secrets. Visions of the future are seen, and prophesies are made. The cruel future which lies ahead reads only of betrayal, abandonment, devastation and anguish.","['fantasy', 'drama', 'action', 'adventure']"

Junjou Romantica:
Misaki, struggling to pass his college entrance exams, is in need of a tutor to help pump up his failing grades. Unfortunately, his only option is the cool and sexy Akihiko Usami. Usami happens to be a famous boys’ love novelist, which doesn’t exactly float Misaki’s boat, especially since his main characters are “Akihiko” and “Takahiro,” the name of Misaki’s older brother and Usami’s childhood friend. Understandably, Misaki is pretty disgusted by the thought of someone using his older brother as his personal fantasy-material, but then after some tender loving from Usami, Misaki is also pretty confused. He may even be developing feelings for the older man...And when Takahiro introduces them to his lovely (female) fiancée, so begins the bumpy relationship of this odd couple, filled with comedy and pure romance. (Source: BLU manga)
Junjou Egoist: Kamijou Hiroki is a broken man, consumed by unrequited love for his childhood friend, Usami Akihiko (the writer character in Junjou Romantica).  Along comes Kusama Nowaki, whose name ""Nowaki"" means ""typhoon"", an orphan working his way through life since middle school.  Like the typhoon he is named for, he whirls into Hiroki's life and heart, blowing all resistance away before him.
Junjou Terrorist: As fate would have it,  Professor Miyagi Yoh (whom Hiroki is working with as assistant professor), and Takatsuki Shinobu, a high school student, cross paths.  Miyagi, when in high school, loved (and still cannot forget) a female teacher who had a terminal illness, is now faced with Shinobu, who just says whatever is on his mind. The wheel of destiny is beginning to turn once again...

She recently recovered from a two-year coma caused by a traffic accident. Prior to the traffic accident, she originally had two personalities, a male personality named Shiki (織), and the original female personality Shiki (式). Children born into the Ryougi family are generally male and are raised with two personalities, so the male personality is customarily called the ""yang"" personality, while the female is called the ""yin"" personality. It is easy to tell which Shiki is speaking at a given time because they both have a distinct style of speaking, most notably that the female Shiki refers to herself with the pronoun watashi (私), while male Shiki refers to himself as ore (俺). After waking from her coma, Shiki discovers that she can no longer feel the male Shiki's presence and assumes that he died because of the accident. She also feels a detachment from her memories before the accident, and while she knows she is Shiki, she does not feel that she is. In the hopes of regaining herself and the ""dead"" Shiki, she puts on a cold facade that somewhat resembles the male Shiki's and tries to act as the female Shiki did. Touko understands the sense of detachment Shiki feels, but considers the current Shiki a third, new personality.

The series is regarded as being set in the same world as another TYPE-MOON series, Tsukihime, with Aoko Aozaki's sister Touko Aozaki being featured in this series and the protagonist of the series, Shiki Ryougi, possessing the same abilities as Tsukihime's protagonist, Shiki Tohno.

And so she is seen as an arrogant, vulgar girl at her school, but all she wants is a girlfriend. Well, that is, until she gets accepted at the Maidens' Club, where she meets a guy named Kirie, with a somewhat unique habit that happens when a girl comes within a foot of him. And everyone says he's gay, even Hatsune. How will these two fare? Will Hatsune have a girlfriend at last? Will he be more than just a friend?

Trigun Maximum,finished,https://media.kitsu.io/manga/poster_images/1575/large.jpg?1434252696,102,14,79.31,1022,"Much of the damage attributed to ""Vash"" is caused by the activities of bounty hunters who are after the 60,000,000,000$$ (sixty billion ""double dollars"") reward on Vash's head for the destruction of a city called July. Vash does not clearly remember the destruction of July, and only wants ""love and peace"", as he puts it; though he is a gunfighter of inhuman skill, he uses his weapons only to save lives wherever he can.
As the series progresses, more is gradually learned about Vash's mysterious history and the history of the human civilization on Gunsmoke, the desert planet the series is set on. The series is often humorous in tone, but at the same time it involves very serious character development and especially in later episodes it becomes quite emotionally intense. Vash is occasionally joined by a priest, Nicholas D. Wolfwood, who is almost as good a gunfighter as Vash himself, and later is targeted by a band of assassins known as the Gung-Ho Guns for reasons which are mysterious at first.
Trigun evolves into a very serious discussion of the nature of morality, posing questions such as: What is the nature of morality? Can we judge different moral codes? If a person is forced to betray their moral code, does that betrayal invalidate that moral code, and can the person still try to live up to that moral code? Can the person find redemption from their wrongs, and if so, how?

Out of the gate poured soldiers and strange creatures, and they soon made Ginza look like an image of hell. The gate apparently connected Japan to another world, a world with a militant empire and many supernatural creatures. The Japanese Self-Defense Force decided to send a small group, led by a soldier who's also an otaku, into the other world on a reconnaissance mission. They're meant to learn what they can about the empire (and its plans), the world, and the people.

They're hardly in the world yet, though, when they come across a village destroyed by a giant fire-breathing dragon. The only survivor is an unconscious elven girl they find hidden in a well. Now they feel like they must warn the nearby towns about the dragon, and do what they can to help. On the way, they'll meet more magical, female companions, and learn more about this dangerous new world.

After death, he met a god of reincarnation who requested that the hundred or so dead passengers—one of them being the girl he tried in vain to save—be reincarnated into another world.

Yet a series of unfortunate events forced Hiroto to reincarnate with even less luck than before, starting with nothing but a tremendous amount of Mana. His second life, far worse than his first, came to a cruel end.

However, upon meeting the god a second time, he was informed that there would be yet another reincarnation—one that had already been set in motion and could not be stopped. Not wanting Hiroto to live long, the god cursed him before he was reborn in the hopes that he would either die quickly or commit suicide.

Hiroto was reborn once more as a half-Vampire, half-Dark Elf. A Dhampir. Not wanting a fourth life, he is determined to live this third life with the only things remaining from his previous lives—death-attribute magic and his enormous Mana pool.

Kubikiri Asa,finished,https://media.kitsu.io/manga/poster_images/3585/large.jpg?1435592848,54,10,78.72,389,"In a prison world, there are few good stories, and this is the world of Kubikiri Asa, the beheader and master samurai under the Shogun. It's a world full of vengeance, greed, and violence. A world of depravity and sin. One man can set things straight if he can keep his wits. This is a story of extreme proportions, of sword study thick in tradition and with grim purpose, of blood rivers, agonizing screams, bondage, torture, and the evil prevalent in human failure. Drafted by the confirmed masters of the international medium of manga, Samurai Executioner is a shocking combination of darkness and fire, fine lines, and a fine man in the face of human decline.
