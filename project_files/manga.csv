Enter Monkey D. Luffy, a 17-year-old boy that defies your standard definition of a pirate.

Following in the footsteps of his childhood hero, Luffy and his crew travel across the Grand Line, experiencing crazy adventures, unveiling dark mysteries and battling strong enemies, all in order to reach One Piece.

She recently recovered from a two-year coma caused by a traffic accident. Prior to the traffic accident, she originally had two personalities, a male personality named Shiki (織), and the original female personality Shiki (式). Children born into the Ryougi family are generally male and are raised with two personalities, so the male personality is customarily called the ""yang"" personality, while the female is called the ""yin"" personality. It is easy to tell which Shiki is speaking at a given time because they both have a distinct style of speaking, most notably that the female Shiki refers to herself with the pronoun watashi (私), while male Shiki refers to himself as ore (俺). After waking from her coma, Shiki discovers that she can no longer feel the male Shiki's presence and assumes that he died because of the accident. She also feels a detachment from her memories before the accident, and while she knows she is Shiki, she does not feel that she is. In the hopes of regaining herself and the ""dead"" Shiki, she puts on a cold facade that somewhat resembles the male Shiki's and tries to act as the female Shiki did. Touko understands the sense of detachment Shiki feels, but considers the current Shiki a third, new personality.

The series is regarded as being set in the same world as another TYPE-MOON series, Tsukihime, with Aoko Aozaki's sister Touko Aozaki being featured in this series and the protagonist of the series, Shiki Ryougi, possessing the same abilities as Tsukihime's protagonist, Shiki Tohno.

Ushio's family maintains a Shinto temple in Japan, where ~500 years ago, his samurai ancestor battled that same tiger to a standstill, and eventually trapped him against a rock using a blessed spear called the ""Beast Spear"", which in addition to its intrinsic formidability as a weapon, can also endow its wielder with the martial ability of the ancestor who originally wielded it. Ushio accidentally unsealed the cave Tora was trapped in.

Initially, Ushio refuses to remove the spear pinning Tora down (as Tora made the strategic blunder of mentioning that the first thing he would do upon being freed would be to devour Ushio), but Tora's unsealed presence summons various monsters who wish to fight him, and by extension Ushio. Ushio is forced to free Tora, who would like to eat Ushio, but dares not since Ushio keeps the spear close by. The series focuses on their relationship, interspersed with battles against mythological foes, and with Tora's attempts to grapple with modern life.

The story also includes Ushio's relationships with two girls: the tomboyish Asako Nakamura and the feminine Mayuko Inoue.

Episodic in nature, most of the manga is a series of fights with different youkai or other creatures from Japanese legend. But at thirty-three volumes, the story continues far past the events of the anime, and leads to an epic conclusion.

Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu,Finished,https://media.kitsu.io/manga/poster_images/14464/large.jpg?1468542593,132,14,77.88,"The story is staged in the distant future within our own Milky Way Galaxy, approximately in the 35th century. Unlike other science fiction stories, there are no alien civilizations. A portion of the galaxy is filled with terraformed worlds inhabited by interstellar traveling human beings. For 150 years two mighty space powers have intermittently warred with each other: the Galactic Empire and the Free Planets Alliance.
Within the Galactic Empire, based on 19th century Prussia, an ambitious military genius, Reinhard von Müsel, is rising to power. He is driven by the desire to free his sister Annerose, who was taken by the Kaiser as a concubine. Later, he wants not only to end the corrupt Goldenbaum dynasty but also to defeat the Free Planets Alliance and to unify the whole galaxy under his rule.
In the Free Planets Alliance is another genius, Yang Wen-li. He originally aspired to become a historian, and joined the military only because he needed money for tuition. He was rapidly promoted to an admiral because of his demonstrated excellence in military strategy. He becomes the archrival of Reinhard, though they highly respect one another.
As a historian, Yang often narrates the rich history of his world and comments on it. One of his famous quotes is: ""There are few wars between good and evil; most are between one good and another good.""
Besides the two main heroes, the story is full of vivid characters and intricate politics. All types of characters, from high nobility, admirals and politicians, to common soldiers and farmers, are interwoven into the story. There is a third neutral power nominally attached to the Galactic Empire called the Phezzan Dominion, a planet-state (city-state on a galactic scale) which trades with both warring powers. There is also a Terraism cult, which claims that humans should go back to Earth, gaining popularity throughout the galaxy. The story frequently switches away from the main heroes to the Unknown Soldier fighting for his life on the battlefield.
Contains 10 main volumes and 4 prequel volumes, as well as 5 uncollected short stories.
Volumes 1-10 are entitled:  Dawn (黎明篇); Ambition (野望篇); Biding His Time (雌伏篇); Strategem (策謀篇); A Hero's Chance (風雲篇); Soaring High (飛翔篇); Great Upheaval (怒濤篇); Chaos (乱離篇); Resurgence of Power (回天篇); Sunset (落日篇) (unofficial English translations, edited by MAL)

Of course, the thrill wears off as soon as Kimihiro realizes that his payment plan bears a disturbing resemblance to indentured servitude . . . eternal indentured servitude. Still he soldiers on, ready for whatever number of adventures lie ahead. But in Kimihiro’s case, three may not be the charm!
His first assignment–to procure a pair of fake eyeglasses–is exceptionally pointless, even by Yûko’s standards. Or at least it seems that way, until Kimihiro watches a woman throw herself into traffic. He soon discovers that the doors of bespectacled perception can swing both ways.
Next, when a classmate seeks help solving a mystery involving text messages from the dead, Kimihiro is glad to play Sherlock. But he must turn to Yûko to determine whether the root of the riddle is otherworldly shenanigans, deceit, or murder.
Finally, however ready, willing, and able Kimihiro thinks he is to face the most unusual of circumstances, he still finds himself completely bewildered by the stranger who chases away his darkest spirits, condemns Yûko as a craven charlatan, and offers Kimihiro a way out of his preternatural predicament–and a fortune besides.

He moved to Tokyo where he was assistant to Rentaro Itai and debuted in manga in 1969. Throughout the 70´s and 80´s he produced a large body of work in many genres including the comedies FUTARI TO GONIN (Two People and Five) and YAKEKUSO TENSHI (Desperate Angel), the Science Fiction Seiun (Japanese Hugo) Award winning FUJOURI NIKKI (Absurd Diary) and is also known as the father of Lolicon manga. But the pressures told and, in 1989, he ran away from his responsibilities and went homeless. After this experience and his eventual return to normal life, he then repeated the cycle in 1992, this time becoming a gas pipe layer in another town. Later, in 1998, his alcoholism was so bad that he was forced into rehab. This book is his expression of those three periods of his life told, not in a deep or depressed way but, as befits his nature, in a buoyant and cheerful cartoon art and is a welcome addition to the ""personal manga"" genre. In 2005, SHISSOU NIKKI (Disappearance Diary) was awarded the Grand Prize from the 9th Japan Media Arts Festival Manga Division and the Excellence Price at the 34th Japan Cartoonists Association Awards.

Dr. Slump,Finished,https://media.kitsu.io/manga/poster_images/1752/large.jpg?1434253097,236,18,76.29,"Dr. Slump is filled with puns, sexual references, and bathroom jokes, and parodies of both Japanese and American culture. For example, one of the recurring characters is ""Suppaman"", a short, fat, pompous buffoon who transforms into a Superman-like costume by eating a sour-tasting (""suppai"" in Japanese) umeboshi. Unlike Superman, Suppaman can't fly, and instead pretends to fly by lying belly down on a skateboard and scooting through the streets. Also, a policeman in Dr. Slump can be seen wearing a Star Wars-style storm trooper helmet, just as in the American movies. The Dr. Slump manga has been licensed by Viz Media and is currently being published in graphic novel form, with having most of the sexual references and humor, nudity, and as well as alcohol usage and references edited out or censored. Dr. Slump and the anime based on it have been run in almost everywhere else in the West; for example, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico and Spain.
Dr. Slump is set in Penguin Village (ペンギン村 Pengin Mura), a place where humans co-exist with all sorts of anthropormorphic animals and other objects. In this village lives Senbei Norimaki (則巻千兵衛 Norimaki Senbei), an inventor (his name is a pun on a kind of rice cracker). His nickname is ""Dr. Slump"" (a joke that can be seen as similar to nicknaming an author ""Writer's Block."") In the first issue, he builds a little robot girl he names Arale Norimaki (則巻アラレ Norimaki Arare, a pun on another kind of rice cracker), in scenes obviously parodying the Italian children's classic Pinocchio (note: ""Arale"" is Toriyama's official romanized spelling of her name). Because Senbei is a lousy inventor, she soon turns out to be in severe need of eyeglasses. She is also very naïve, and in later issues she has adventures such as bringing a huge bear home, having mistaken it for a pet. To Senbei's credit, she does have super-strength. In general, the manga focuses on Arale's misunderstandings of humanity and Senbei's inventions, rivalries, and romantic misadventures.

ACROSS, a group devoted to carrying out and accomplishing the ideals of absent-minded yet bishounen Il Palazzo, feels that the first step in conquering the entire planet would be conquering a single city.  This city just so happens to be Fukuoka, where our story takes place.
Along with the ""help"" of overly energetic Excel and oft-dead Hyatt, the leader (and self-proclaimed Lord) of ACROSS strives to make the planet better through domination.  Elgala, whose personality constantly irritates Excel, joins ACROSS in volume 8.
Meanwhile, Dr. Kabapu (the Dr. part is very important!!) starts the Department of City Security, in hopes of protecting the city from people who would want to conquer it.  Watanabe, Iwata, and Sumiyoshi, three slackers, join his staff, and are later joined by Misaki Matsuya, who missed the introductory staff meeting.
Helping Dr. Kabapu is Professor Shiouji, the most brilliant scientific mind in all of Fukuoka (who just so happens to be a VERY blatant pedophile).  The professor creates Ropponmatsu, an android modeled after a female human.  After she explodes in a bomb crisis (accidentally caused by Excel and Hyatt), he creates a second model more to his tastes (if you know what I mean).

Elfen Lied,Finished,https://media.kitsu.io/manga/poster_images/2037/large.jpg?1434253697,113,12,75.94,"The story involves human mutations called ""diclonii"", who are born with horns on their heads and possess telekinetic powers, in the form of invisible ""arms"" called vectors. The power of these arms vary, but they can stop normal bullets and deflect some others. The number of them differ with each diclinous, as does their full range.
The tendency for violence among diclonii is high, especially as they grow older. As children, their violence stems from a certain playfulness, unlike the absolute hatred of humans in their later years. Diclonii are rare, as they are the members of their species that are able to reproduce naturally.
Silpelits are more common. They are the offspring of two humans, the male of which has been infected with the mutation. Interestingly, only males can pass on the genes, and all diclonii and silpelits turn out to be female. Certain scientists noticed an increasing number of babies with horns being born, along with those children murdering their own parents and others, and tried to contain the spreading and find out the cause by placing them in a Facility in cells where they are subject to inhumane experiments to test their abilities or where they await execution for being too dangerous.
The main non-mutant character in the story is Kouta, who ends up becoming increasingly involved with one diclonius in particular, the main mutant character Lucy, the only pure diclonius, as she seeks a way to infect or kill all of humanity. Lucy has a cruel and unsettling past, and she has long since lost her empathy for humans, except for Kouta.
However, Director Kakuzawa, who has diclonius ancestry although he doesn't have the vectors, has plans to mate with Lucy and start a true diclonius race. If Lucy is found and he manages to do so, humanity will be nonexistent.
Kouta and Lucy's lives have been intertwined since their childhood, but not necessarily in a good way. And after the virus is airborne and spread across all of Japan, what is the fate of humanity and who holds all of the answers?

Vash does not clearly remember the destruction of July, and only wants ""love and peace"", as he puts it; though he is a gunfighter of inhuman skill, he uses his weapons only to save lives wherever he can.
As the series progresses, more is gradually learned about Vash's mysterious history and the history of the human civilization on Gunsmoke, the desert planet the series is set on. The series is often humorous in tone, but at the same time it involves very serious character development and especially in later episodes it becomes quite emotionally intense. Vash is occasionally joined by a priest, Nicholas D. Wolfwood, who is almost as good a gunfighter as Vash himself, and later is targeted by a band of assassins known as the Gung-Ho Guns for reasons which are mysterious at first.
Trigun evolves into a very serious discussion of the nature of morality, posing questions such as: What is the nature of morality? Can we judge different moral codes? If a person is forced to betray their moral code, does that betrayal invalidate that moral code, and can the person still try to live up to that moral code?

In 'Yokubou Shounen', there's only one story that takes us to the fantastic; the rest are tales about more or less ordinary people.
In the first two one-shots we'll get to meet a teacher, Matsunae Suguru, and his handsome, self-searching young student Shinobu, and then again Shinobu, causing confusion between his two schoolmates, Hideya and Makoto, who are hopelessly in love - but sweetly clueless about how to get it going. The third story, 'Love Snatcher', is an absolutely gorgeous fantasy. Once again Naono-sensei proves her skill at drawing animals, and the mysterious Tigure is truly an eyeful. The last two one-shots are very emotional, painted with doubt and misunderstandings, and the fact that Naono-sensei is a master at creating unique individuals really shows this time as well.
Consists of a collection of oneshots:
1) A Desire Boy (Yokubou Shounen)
2) Sawaki's Case
3) Love Snatcher- After getting fired from his job half Japanese Tanaka Tatsuaki drunkenly prays to the moon to take him away, and it does! He's been summoned to a land of shape-shifters to be the bride of Tigure, lord of the tigers. And he's expected to give birth?
4) Love and Reticence (Ai to Chinmoku)-Nearly silent ghost writer Kisa has fallen in love with a small out of the way diner and the delicious food there. But handsome owner-san wants more from Kisa than his patronage.
5) Drowning in Love (Oboreru Kankei)- Yoshino Keiichi's life has gotten a lot more interesting since single father Kayumi Takamasa and his two young children moved in next door. Keiichi's become a mother to the youngsters, but his relationship with their father is much more complex...

This has caused a lot of trouble in his life, but now he has learned to fight back against the evil spirits! Unfortunately, he's now also very poor, homeless, and hoping for a happier, more normal, high school life. In his search for housing, he's introduced to a very cheap boarding house called Yuragisou, which was formerly a popular hot springs inn. It's so cheap because the house is haunted by the spirit of a high school student whose corpse was found there.

Kogarashi doesn't think this is going to be a problem for him, and the rest of the house's tenants appear to be sexy women. While relaxing in the hot springs, though, he finds there is an issue with his ghost-banishing plan; Yuragisou's ghost is a 16-year-old girl named Yuna, who lives in his room. Kogarashi has no desire to hurt a ghost girl, and instead he ends up agreeing to help her to figure out her unfinished business. That way, she can move onto the afterlife before turning evil and falling into hell. Once it is clear that he is fine with Yuna, the other tenants reveal their own supernatural secrets—his life in Yuragisou is going to be far from ordinary!

However, when the girls were in first grade, their grandmother became ill and so, Ageha was sent to live with her parents and her twin sister in the city.
The two girls are in high school now, and are complete opposites. Growing up in the countryside has made Ageha a bit of a tomboy; she's a quiet, reserved girl who doesn't look anything special. Hana, on the other hand, is outgoing, gorgeous and popular at school. Regardless, the two girls appear to have a stable, good relationship with one another.

Ageha feels as if she's Cinderella who didn't get invited to go to the ball. Just when she was thinking those thoughts, a boy wearing a horse mask on his head runs into the classroom and hides underneath a table. His name is Kyuu. It turns out he's being chased by some girls. After the girls leave, Ageha is startled by Kyuu who demands that she serve him coffee. As she does so, Kyuu flips through her agenda booklet and discovers a photograph of Ageha and the boy she has a crush on, Ryuusei, who she has known from childhood but since they moved away, they have forgotten each other. Kyuu asks if she likes Ryuusei, and if she wants to be Ryuusei's girlfriend in a teasing sort of way, causing much embarrassment to the girl. Kyuu then tells her that if she believes in her heart that it is possible, it could come true. Kyuu tells her to shout out that she's Ryuusei's girlfriend and that they are going out and her life is very good, which Ageha does so. As soon as she speaks the words, Ryuusei appears at the classroom door, and recognizes Ageha as the girl from his childhood that he used to play with. Ageha secretly thinks of Kyuu as Cinderella's fairy godmother and cannot believe that it happened.
However, as Ageha and Ryuusei rekindle a friendship from long ago, Hana becomes suspicious or jealous of Ageha's relationship with Ryuusei. She becomes especially annoyed when she finds out that Ryuusei prefers Ageha to her.

His room is a testament to his embarrassing commitment; it is more or less a shrine to his favorite idol, the walls covered with her posters and CDs littering the space. With almost equal fervor, Mikado hates his work superior, Misaki Anezaki, who is competent at his job but hardly tolerable as a boss and a person. From digging into Mikado's stash of cup noodles to mercilessly pushing all his grunt work onto his underling, Anezaki's list of crimes is never-ending. But Mikado's perception of his boss as a no-good pain in the neck is about to change when he is forced to retreat to a love hotel with the drunk, out-of-control Anezaki to escape a downpour—and wakes up in the middle of the night to find his superior doing some pretty unspeakable things to him.

""Romance Dawn"" represents the slow progression of the author's ideas in his desire to create a manga about pirates, whose inspiration was drawn largely from his own childhood interests. While a first-year junior high school student, he began sketching out ideas for a pirate-themed manga in a notbeook, in pencil. Years later, as an assistant to Rurouni Kenshin author Nobuhiro Watsuki, he began refining his ideas into what would become ""Romance Dawn,"" and later, One Piece. All 3 versions were published in Weekly Shonen Jump magazine, with the final incarnation published exactly one year after the first. The author made significant alterations to the premise and plot over the course of the three chapters, which will be examined in-depth below.

Magika no Kenshi to Basileus,Ongoing,https://media.kitsu.io/manga/poster_images/25523/large.jpg?1434305115,,0,69.88,"15 years ago the world discovered magic as well as mythical beings (basically beings from various legends) in another dimension. Humankind learned to summon these dangerous mythical beings and use their power to great effect. 7 country's formed contracts with these ""gods"" and gained their alligence as a result. Gods will chose their summoners on their 14th birthday and give them a stigma. Schools have been set up to train summoners and magical swordsman (basically bodyguards that give the summoners time to cast their spell) as a result.

15 years later after the finding of magic Kazuki Hayashizaki is chosen as a summoner and given a stigma to indicate that. This is surprising since males aren't chosen as summoners due to their low amount of mana compared to females. As the first male to be a summoner Kazuki is under a lot of scrutiny by almost everyone.

To complicate matters his sister (who's a magical swordsman) is against him going into summoner school to train there as a summoner. Because summoners and magical swordsman have a cat mouse thing going on where summoners look down on magical swordsman as inferior so his sister naturally is against him going there. She'll stop him even if it means going to war.

Kazuki however is determined to thrive in summoner school and have already determined to give it his all. Even if he's the lowest ranked student (ranked E) and his fellow students intend to demean him he'll prove himself as the strongest summoner.

Nobody knows why he has come to that school or what the real motivations behind his actions are.

The story centers around the various matches he undertakes and the interactions between the various characters, like Mika Shishidou, the beautiful granddaughter of the school headmaster, who is highly intelligent but contemptuous and superb, or Abidani, the vampiric looking dorm superintendent and main villain (for now) in the series, who has a sadistic personality and whose goal is to make Tom leave his school (or to get him killed).

Only one surviving were the humans, as they were able to use technology to artificially sustain themselves. They eventually created enhanced humans, which were able to live on the ruined planet, and A-rays, creatures created with genetic engineering by combining humans and various other extinct life forms.
A war breaks out between enhanced humans and A-rays, resulting in complete devastation of what was left of Earth, as well as the near extinction of enhanced humans.

With a combination of sparse line work and visual codes borrowed from animation and film, the quiet melancholy lives of a young couple struggling to make ends meet are beautifully captured in this poetic masterpiece.
Uninvolved with the political movements of the time, Ichiro and Sachiko hope for something better, but they're no revolutionaries; their spare time is spent drinking, smoking, daydreaming, and sleeping--together and at times with others. While Ichiro attempts to make a living from his comics, Sachiko's parents are eager to arrange a marriage for her, but Ichiro doesn't seem interested. Both in their relationship and at work, Ichiro and Sachiko are unable to say the things they need to say, and like any couple, at times say things to each other that they do not mean, ultimately communicating as much with their body language and what remains unsaid as with words.
Red Colored Elegy is informed as much by underground Japanese comics of the time as it is by the French Nouvelle Vague, and its cultural referents range from James Dean to Ken Takakura. Its influence in Japan was so large that Morio Agata, a prominent Japanese folk musician and singer songwriter, debuted with a love song written and named after it.

A person named Shōgun joins the chatroom though he does not say a word until Grim has left the chatroom. Shōgun confronts Takumi and presents him with a barrage of image links that depicts a very gruesome murder.
The next day, as Takumi was heading home after spending the afternoon at an Internet cafe, he comes across the same scene that he witnessed yesterday in Shōgun's pictures. He runs away from the crime scene screaming, but not before meeting a pink-haired girl there covered in blood and wearing Suimei Academy's uniform.
The story progresses from here with Takumi trying to avoid getting involved with Shōgun and other New Generation events as he is slowly caught in a grander scheme's wheels of motion.","['sci-fi', 'mystery', 'supernatural', 'horror']"
